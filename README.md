<p align="center">A project aiming to predict market prices on Hypixel Skyblock's bazaar using Neural Networks!</p>

-----
Introduction
-----
This is a quick little project i've been working on for the past week that uses XXX neural networks to predict bazaar buy and sell prices. It could probably also predict buy and sell volumes and whatnot, but it probably won't be as accurate.

I don't exactly have a website for people to see the predicted prices and whatnot because i'm too lazy to set one up, so i've just left the `.h5` models under the output folder. Though, I do plan on creating an interactive demo soon enough.

How it was done
-----
The project isn't exactly finished yet as it's still in the data collection phase, but here's a little make-shift blog i'll try to update regularly with info reguarding how i'm going about this project. [Blog](https://github.com/uploak/bazauger/new/main)
